# code-snippets

I'm a data enthusiast with a science background who learned code to do bioinformatics. I've created this repository to record pieces of code I've written to visualise data or solve problems I've encountered along the way.

So far these include:
* a shell script that creates a master list of differentially expressed genes from multiple Nanostring results input files
* an R markdown script that takes as input the results of T cell epitope preditions generated by NetMHCpan, and graphically displays their relative rankings
* a summary document outlining challenges I encountered when performing ChIP-seq data comparisons on a project that formed part of my PhD
